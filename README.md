# CollatzConjecture

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows:
Start with any positive integer n. 
If the term is even, the next term is term/2. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3*term+1. 
The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1

Program allows to imput the start number, and desired number of steps to reach.
